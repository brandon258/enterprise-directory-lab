# enterprise-directory-lab
Hands-on lab for designing and automating enterprise directory services in hybrid environments.  It demonstrates the full lifecycle of Active Directory domains, Entra ID integration, and Okta Universal Directory, with emphasis on automation, security, and migration.

# Key highlights:
- AD Domain Lifecycle: forest creation, DC promotion/demotion, functional level upgrades, decommissioning, backup/restore.
- Hybrid Identity: Azure AD Connect configuration, Entra PIM/JIT access, directory synchronization.
- Okta Universal Directory: API-driven provisioning and schema extensions.
- Automation: Advanced PowerShell scripts for domain health, reporting, Graph API, and Okta REST API.
- Security & Zero Trust: PIM, privileged account workflows, baseline GPOs, and DR runbooks.
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform for Azure VMs and networking, GitHub Actions for validation and Pester tests.
- Migration & Trusts: Two-forest scenarios, cross-forest trusts, staged migrations, and runbooks.

This repo is intended as a portfolio and learning lab, showing how to engineer and operate hybrid identity infrastructure with modern security patterns.
